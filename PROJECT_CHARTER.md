### MinuteHub Integration Specification

**Overview:**
MinuteHub is a meeting minutes management system. FollowUpHub integrates with MinuteHub to automatically import resolutions and track their implementation.

**Integration Methods:**

1. **Webhook Integration**
   - MinuteHub sends webhook on meeting conclusion
   - Payload includes resolutions, attendees, metadata
   - FollowUpHub creates resolutions automatically
   - Webhook endpoint: `POST /api/webhooks/minutehub`
   - Authentication: Shared secret key

2. **REST API Integration**
   - FollowUpHub can query MinuteHub API
   - Retrieve meeting details on demand
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/minutehub/meetings/:id`
   - Authentication: API key

3. **Status Synchronization**
   - FollowUpHub updates MinuteHub with resolution status
   - Bidirectional sync (configurable)
   - Webhook: `POST /api/webhooks/followuphub` (to MinuteHub)
   - Frequency: Real-time or scheduled

**Data Mapping:**

| **MinuteHub Field** | **FollowUpHub Field** | **Type** |
|--------------------|-----------------------|----------|
| resolution_text | resolution.description | string |
| resolution_type | resolution.type | enum (ILIELEKEZA/ILISHAURIWA) |
| assigned_to | assignment.assignee_id | UUID |
| due_date | assignment.deadline | date |
| priority | assignment.priority | enum |
| meeting_id | resolution.external_ref | UUID |
| status | assignment.status | enum |

**Error Handling:**
- Invalid webhook signature: Reject with 401
- Missing required fields: Reject with 400
- Duplicate resolution: Skip with 200
- MinuteHub unavailable: Retry 3 times, then queue
- Data conflict: Log for manual resolution

**Security:**
- HMAC signature verification (SHA-256)
- IP whitelist (configurable)
- Rate limiting (100 requests/hour)
- Audit logging (all webhook events)

### AI Agent Configuration

**Preferred LLM Settings:**
- Model: GPT-4 or equivalent
- Temperature: 0.3 (precise, compliance-focused)
- Max tokens: 4096
- Top-p: 0.9

**Context Windows:**
- Always include: PROJECT_CHARTER.md (this file)
- Security context: SECURITY_POLICY.md
- API context: API_DOCUMENTATION.md
- Database context: DATABASE_SCHEMA.md

**Safety Guidelines:**
- Never generate insecure code patterns
- Always validate against OWASP Top 10
- Highlight compliance implications
- Reference charter sections when applicable

**Code Generation Preferences:**
- Verbose error messages (development)
- Generic error messages (production)
- Comprehensive logging
- Defensive programming
- Fail-safe defaults
