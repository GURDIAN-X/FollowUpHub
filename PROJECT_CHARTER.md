  📋 Tengeneza Yatokanayo
</button>

// 2. API ENDPOINT (MinuteHub calls FollowUpHub)
POST https://api.followuphub.udom.ac.tz/v1/generate

}

// 3. POPUP MODAL (FollowUpHub opens in MinuteHub)
<div 
  id="followuphub-modal"
  data-integration-mode="embedded"
  data-parent-system="minutehub"
>
  <!-- FollowUpHub content loads here -->
</div>

// 4. SUCCESS CALLBACK (FollowUpHub → MinuteHub)
window.parent.postMessage({
  event: 'yatokanayo_generated',
  yatokanayo_id: 'yatokanayo-2025-08-29-001',
  status: 'success',
  items_count: 4
}, 'https://minutehub.udom.ac.tz');
12.2 Integration Testing Markers
Test Scenarios:
javascript// TEST 1: Button visibility
describe('MinuteHub Integration - Button', () => {
  test('should show button only when Muhtasari is complete', () => {
    expect(isButtonVisible()).toBe(true);
